Post

Sometimes referred to as Pages, Posts are the basic unit of content within a
[Wiki].  Every Post has a unique ID and may have one or more [Names][Name].

A Post's content is represented in a plain text format reffered to as
[WikiText].  This is the literal content of a Post as typed by a [User].

[Text] is the name given to the content of a Post after any special WikiText
markup has been removed.

Every Post has a [Name] which is simply the first line of content of the Post's
Text.

A Post may [Link] to another Post in a Wiki by simply surrounding the Post's
Name in square brackets, like this `[My Post Name]`.

It is possible to have multiple Posts in the same Wiki with the same Name.
[PostWiki] provides a mechanism to [Qualify Names][Name Qualification] to
prevent ambiguity in references.
