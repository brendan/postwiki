<h1>WikiText</h1>

<p>The content of a [Post] is recorded in WikiText, which is a superset of the
lightweight syntax for web content authoring known as [Markdown][1].</p>

<p>The essential difference between Markdown and WikiText is the addition of a
syntax for inter-Post [Linking][Link].</p>

<p>If you are familiar with Markdown, you know that <code>[display text][reference]</code> is
the way you specify external links in your documents.  Markdown's existing
linking behavior is essentially unaffected.</p>

<p>If you surround any word or phrase in square brackets <code>[like this]</code>, then
PostWiki will treat it as a Link to another Post.</p>

<p>If you use a <code>[display text][reference]</code> style link in your document and there
is nothing found in the document matching "<code>[reference]: ...</code>" then it will treat
<code>[reference]</code> as a Link to a Post called "reference".</p>
